                <h4 class="head">108 feet Maitreya Buddha Statue</h4>
                <p>It is however, the 108 feet statue of Maitreya Buddha, a major tourist attraction in Nubra Valley, that surprises & leaves onlookers amazed.The gold and red coloured statue faces the Shyok River towards Pakistan and is situated right below the Diskit Monastery atop a hill.</p>
              <p>The statue, besides its aesthetic and spiritual significance, is believed to embody three ideas: protection of the Diskit Village, promotion of world peace & prevention of further war with Pakistan. <br>The main festival celebrated in Diskit Monastery is Dosmoche, or Desmochhey, which means, “Festival of the Scapegoat.” It attracts large crowds of people from the villages in Nubra Valley.
                The highlight of the festival is the Chham Dance, which is more famously known among tourists as masked dances. These are performed by the Lamas of the monastery, who believe that performing them wards of any ill fortune.<br><br>Images made of dough are also thrown out to prevent the occurrence of any disaster, and welcome peace and prosperity everywhere. The clothes, which cover the deities, are removed during the course of the festival.</p>
