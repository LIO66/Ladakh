                <h4 class="head">About Suru Valley Ladakh</h4>
                <p>Suru Valley is famous not just as the most fertile, but also as the most picturesque valley in all of Ladakh. The Suru River runs through the valley, which is dotted with scenic villages. It is a must visit place for tourists for its charming landscape, sightseeing opportunities, photography and spectacular views.<br><br>The Suru Valley lies just across the Pensi La on the Kargil Road. It extends from Kargil in the south towards Zanskar, for a length of around 85 kilometers.</p>
                <h4 class="head">History of Suru Valley</h4>
                <p>The region, which we today known as Suru Valley, was once composed of small chiefdoms. In the early 18th century, it became part of the Purig kingdom. In the 16th century, Islam was introduced to it from preachers travelling via Baltistan.</p>
                 <p>While Purig was taken over by the Namgyal dynasty of Ladakh in the mid 18th century, the Dogras captured the entire region by 1847. Today, the Line of Control (LoC) runs close to Kargil.</p>
